It is better to perform a random neighbour mutation on the current best solution rather than completely randomise it as a small mutation in the solution is more likely to get you closer to the optimum than a complete randomisation of the solution given, which would more likely take you further away from the optimum.\n",

In relation to the colours we want a smaller euclidian distance to achieve colours that are in better order. The hill-climb takes a variable called neighbourType which will determine how the random neighbour of the solution will be found.

    "The following demonstrates the effectiveness of the different random neighbour strategies. It takes multiple, runs of the multi_hc method where it tries multiple hill-climbs each with either the swap, scramble, or inversion method. It prints out the solution found, the best Euclidean distance found and a colour plot for each. This is done for the original random solution, swap, inversion, and scramble. It also displays a graph that has the trace of each to make the contrast of each performance easier to read. Finally, the best information for the best run is displayed as well as the name for the specific method that found it. The number of iterations for this is pretty low as I am only looking to demonstrate the contrast in performance rather than find the best euclidean distance."

    "The swap method produces much better results than either the scramble or inversion. This is because mutations to the solution at each iteration of the hill-climb are small so with enough iterations we can get close to the optimum. The scramble and inversion mutations alter multiple points in the solution so as the solution gets closer to the optimum the chance of making progress is reduced due to the fact the large number of random changes is more likely to take you further from the optimum than closer to it. Comparing the inversion and scramble shows that although they produce similar values the inversion is the worse of the two. This is because with the scramble method the points are randomised so there is a chance that some points will stay the same meaning a smaller increment is made whereas with inversion all the points are guaranteed to have changed and as mentioned before the large increments of change in the solution when getting towards the best the higher chance it is of taking a step backward than a step forward."

These solutions were achieved by using the swap method as the random neighbour as from testing the other methods we can see this method produces the lowest euclidean distance.
